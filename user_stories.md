***As a developer working for Bus-Mall...***
1. As a developer, I need to develop an app, showing a catalog of items for Bus-Mall's research study, gauging which items the members of the focus group on the bus would mostly like to buy by clicking on the item.
2. As a developer, I need to create the app that is user friendly with clear direction.  I would do this by adding alert() at the beginning or adding a fixed paragraph.
3. As a developer, I need to show three images at a time, create a click option button on each image so that the user can choose the product that he/she is mostly to buy by clicking on it.  
4. As a developer, I want the user to choose or click on any products or not to click on any products, there is a next button below the three set of images for the user to view the next three set of pictures.  
5. As a developer, I need to able to store each click and keep tag of how many clicks per image.
6. As a developer, I will have it designed so that after clicking on a total of 25 images/products then the result of the 25 images with their votes will automatically show up.
7. As a developer, I want to use css to style the app such that it is stylist and attractive, but not distracting the user from the products.
8. As a developer, to obtain the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown, I need to calculate the number of times each image is displayed and the number of clicks for that image and then calculate the percentage.
